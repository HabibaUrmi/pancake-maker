## ðŸ‘£ Project Steps

### Step 1: Build the Basics

- Used `addEventListener` to detect changes in the form
- Got selected pancake, toppings, and extras from the form
- Calculated total price:
  - Base price + 1â‚¬ per topping + price of extras
- Updated the total price on the page
- Added custom styling and animation for price updates

### Step 2: Refactor & Show Summary

- Replaced multiple event listeners with one on the whole form
- Used arrays to store toppings and extras
- Price updates instantly when anything changes
- Added order summary showing:
  - Customer name
  - Pancake type
  - Toppings & extras
  - Delivery method
  - Total price

### Step 3: Save Orders

- Created an `orders` array to save all orders
- Used `localStorage` so orders donâ€™t disappear after refresh
- Added a new page to view all orders with:
  - Order ID
  - Customer Name
  - Pancake details
  - Delivery method
  - Status (waiting, ready, delivered)
- Made it possible to update order status and save the change
